Regex is a regular expression toolkit for regex-base with:

  * text-replacement operations with named captures;
  * special datatypes for matches and captures;
  * compile-time checking of RE syntax;
  * a unified means of controlling case-sensitivity and multi-line options;
  * high-level AWK-like tools for building text processing apps;
  * the option of using match operators with reduced polymorphism on the
    text and/or result types;
  * regular expression macros including:
      + a number of useful RE macros;
      + a test bench for testing and documenting new macro environments;
  * built-in support for the TDFA and PCRE backends;
